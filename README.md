<h1>Task 1: Software configuration</h1>
<h2>Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge Dare IT Challenge?</h2>

Hello, I'm Agnieszka. I decided to take part in the challenge as a way to learn something new and breach new areas of knowledge. I have many different interests and want to explore them in depth to see which of them will give me the most fun while also providing healthy challenges that I can grow from. 

That is why I decided to try myself in this challenge and ensure I still manage to do something productive during summer. 

My main goal is to learn the basics of automatic testing while doing something practical because I find a hands-on approach best for learning subjects like these.

If you managed to read this far I wish you a great day/night. Remember to stay hydrated!

**_Stay amazing!_**
